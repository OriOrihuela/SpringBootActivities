# SpringBootActivities
## A set of activities in SpringBoot.
### Exercise 1:
- Create a basic project with `SpringBoot` that prints in the web browser the phrase `"Hello World!"`.
### Exercise 2:
- Make the class `HelloApplicationTest` pass the JUnit single test. In order to do that, modify the class `HelloController`, which
prints a wrong message.
### Exercise 3:
- Modify the code to pass all test cases. There are indications throughout the test cases and the class code so you know what you should complete.
### Exercise 4:
- **Spring** makes use of `JUnit`, so let's take advantage of it and maintain our usual `TDD` programming methodology.

To complete the exercise, follow the instructions in the test case file:

`src / test / java / org / formacio / Setmana1Tests.java`
- You should not modify any of the tests unless you want to add more cases or decompose a case into smaller ones.
- Add your code in `src / main / java`.
